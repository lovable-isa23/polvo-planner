## Inspiration
Toasty Polvo is a small-but-growing dessert brand reimagining polvoronâ€”a rich, crumbly Filipino shortbread traditionally gifted during holidays and milestones. They are looking to scale sustainably and intentionally. Our team plans to help them with this by creating a tool that helps the business manage their pastry production. 

## What Tasty PolvoPlanner does
Our business solution aims to make pastry production more efficient by allowing the business owners to see all their orders at a glance and in detail; see the material cost breakdown of each order; help them decide whether to take on an order or not; filter their orders by channel (market, events, online store); and generate pdf reports of orders, ROI, and insights. It has user authentication, a smooth user interface, and an intuitive and customizable user experience.
